# PM2.5 Levels Over Time in the USA and India

## Overview

This project provides an interactive visualization tool to explore PM2.5 levels in major cities across the USA and India. PM2.5, or particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers,
poses significant health risks by penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream. The visualization allows users to analyze how air quality has evolved over time and to identify patterns and trends influenced by various environmental and socio-economic factors.
